# Options Ordering

This Spree extension adds the ability to re-order product option values for a particular option type.
For example if we had an option type called "Color" with the following option values:

Red

Blue

White

This extenstion adds the ability to change the order of these values by simply dragging
and dropping the item into the desired position. A new icon has been added to the option
type edit form that allows the user to select the record and drag it.
